Perhaps not since cinema’s silent age have faces been so familiar without the general public knowing their voices. The vibe is more casual than in previous times, shirt sleeves rather than business suits, but the formula remains the same: a carousel of news, clips, quotes, quips, centred around highlights, all framed within a constant flow of results, fixtures and league tables."

,/sport/2025/jun/11/icc-chair-jay-shah-lords-world-test-championship,"Lord’s looks a little different this week. The grass is the same shade of green, the pavilion still terracotta red, but theInternational Cricket Council, which runs the World Test Championship, has papered over every last trace of everyone else’s branding, from the posters outside publicising Middlesex’s upcoming games, to the sponsors’ logos spray-painted on the outfield. They’ve changed every last hoarding and billboard around the ground, and reprogrammed the three big screens so that they display, throughout the game, the slogans of their own sponsors. “Thums up Cola! Taste the Thunder!”"

After two abandoned attempts to host it at Lord’s, having been diverted first to the Hampshire Bowl and then to The Oval, it is finally being held at cricket’s original headquarters.

The prevailing sense among anybody who ponders aUS Openat this site in rural Pennsylvania is how wonderfully demanding the challenge always is. Cue entertainment. As Xander Schauffele appropriately put it: “I don’t think people turn the TV on to watch some of the guys just hit a 200-yard shot on the green. They turn on the US Open to see a guy shooting eight over and suffer. That’s part of the enjoyment of the US Open for viewers.”

All that could be heard was the deep blare of a horn from a large vehicle, which went on for an uncomfortably long time. Then the realisation dawned. It was the Senegal team bus and the driver was geeing up the gaggle of fans draped in the country’s colours, still ecstatic at howthey had beaten England 3-1."
